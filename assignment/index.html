    <ul>
      <li>In part 1 I struggled to nest an array inside of the object literal. 
        I kept getting an error so I created the array and then declared it inside the object. 
        Is this the proper way, or was I doing something wrong?</li>
      <li>For the find by artist I named the parameter different than Artist so there 
          wouldnt be conflict with existing property within the object, is this necessary?</li>
